Let's first explore the Jupyter notebook. I've opted to do this without using Jupyter directly, as I simply prefer other tools.

We can extract the source code from the supplied notebook quite easily:

```python
import json

with open('pythonKMC.ipynb') as nb:
  content = json.load(nb)
  src = [''.join(c['source']) for c in content['cells']]

```

Now that we have the source code loaded, let's explore it one block at a time.

```python
src[0]
```
